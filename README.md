# ðŸŽ® Game Sales Analysis Using Python

This project explores global video game sales data using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. It focuses on end-to-end data analysis â€” from data cleaning to exploratory data analysis (EDA) and detailed visualizations â€” to uncover trends, patterns, and key insights in the gaming industry.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- Source: VGChartz 2024
- Contains global sales figures, critic scores, genres, release dates, and more.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## ðŸ“Š Key Objectives

1. Clean and preprocess the dataset for analysis.
2. Perform EDA to identify trends across regions, platforms, and genres.
3. Visualize relationships between critic scores and sales.
4. Analyze outliers and correlation between numerical features.
5. Discover time-based patterns and genre popularity over years.

## ðŸ§  Key Insights

- Action and Shooter games lead global sales.
- A positive correlation exists between critic score and total sales.
- Sales performance varies significantly by region.
- Peak game releases occurred during the mid-2000s.
